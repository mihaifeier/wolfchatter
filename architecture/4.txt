I used the websockets library from Spring Framework to implement the live communication between the server and the React app.
The websockets use the TCP protocol.
How it works:
	1. The React app subscribes to the Web socket.
	2. A POST/PUT request is sent by the React app to the server.
	3. The server completes the request and, at the end, publishes an event.
	4. The event is captured in an asynchronous way by the right handler (new marker handler, marker title handler, message handler).
	5. The handler sends the new information to all subscribers.
